			<h2>What matters to me:</h2>
			<p>I've always been fascinated by the ability of interactive technology and media and its impact on our lives. Whether it's an app to help someone through their day or a powerful story told through a game, interactive tech shapes our lives. I take particular interest in the intricacies of human-computer interaction and games as a rhetorical art form!
			</p>

			<p>
			I've always had an interest in computer science and game development, but my time at WPI has allowed me to simulataneously pursue both majors in greater depth. I hope to one day create a program or game remembered for how it improved the lives of others!
