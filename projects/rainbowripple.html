		<section id="About project" class="project-details">
			<h2>About:</h2>
			<p>Rainbow Ripple was created as part of a Digital Game Design class at WPI, and evolved over the course of multiple builds. It was created in <a href="https://perlenspiel.net/" target="_blank">Perlenspiel</a>, an ultra-lightweight, Javascript-based game engine, which intentionally limits graphical possibilities to encourage intelligent, elegant design.  
			</p>
			<p>Players can either click or drag on the white part of the grid to create ripples of randomized colors, which will each create a sound once they hit the sides of the screen. This project was mainly designed to be a fun little toy to mess around with!

			<h2>My thoughts:</h2>
			<p>
				I think this was a solid little toy! Development of this one was mainly about making something satisfying to play around with— if it holds player attention for a solid 30 seconds or so, that's a victory, especially for how simple it is. Unfortunately, it was developed during quite a busy week, but I had plans at the time to make the colors cycle to provide more pleasing rainbow patterns. There's also a bug in here that involves the sound stacking if too many sounds play at once, an unfortunate bug in Perlenspiel itself; it could've easily been alleviated by using an object pool design pattern to track how many sounds play at once. I also planned to have ripples cascade off of each other, but I sacrificed this feature due to framerate issues (though, maybe it could've been fun for the player to "break" the game?)
