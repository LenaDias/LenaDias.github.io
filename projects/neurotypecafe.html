		<section id="About project" class="project-details">
			<h2>About:</h2>
			<p>Neurotype Cafe is a 2+ hour visual novel, coded in Ren'Py/Python, that follows Nia, a neurodivergent barista, as she handles her first week at a new cafe job. Players develop relationships with characters, prepare drinks, and manage their social energy in a thoughtful story about self-accceptance, expectations, and perfectionism.
			</p>

			<p>Neurotype Cafe won a <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/library/archives-special-collections/history/awards/provosts-mqp-awards?field_dept_multi_target_id_entityreference_filter=All&page=2" target="_blank">WPI Provost's Award</a>! One project is picked by faculty each year to recognize the best senior project in each major!

		<section id="Lessons learned" class="project-details">
			<h2>Lessons learned:</h2>
			<h3>Have confidence in your vision.</h3>
			<p>
				I often found myself struggling with intense perfectionism, wanting so badly for this game to be all that I imagined it could be. The more I worked, though, the more I found that what I made <em>was</em> compelling! If I'd spent more time believing in myself, I would've achieved more — I won't be making that mistake next time!
			</p>
			<h3>Plan intensely. Plan specifically.</h3>
			<p>
				One of the greatest challenges of the project was organizing the work schedule in such a way that would allow us to write and code a lengthy story that thoughtfully represents neurodiverse experiences. We could've never made what we did if not for a <em>lot</em> of up-front planning work. More specific, intense planning, such as including precise artistic goals for those story beats, could've made for an even more cohesive piece of art.
			</p>
			<h3>Find the scenarios where your team thrives.</h3>
			<p>
				Part of what made Neurotype Cafe so successful, I feel, was continuous attention not only to the needs of the project, but to the creative and life needs of the team. People do their best work when they are allowed to express their passion; as a producer and team member, guiding that passion and directing it where it can flourish is critical. The project plan was also designed to be flexible to allow us to cut back scope should life get in the way.
