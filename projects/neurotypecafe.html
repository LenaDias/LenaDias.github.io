			<h2>About:</h2>
			<p>During their senior year, WPI undergraduate students are expected to complete a <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/project-based-learning/project-based-education/major-qualifying-project" target="_blank">Major Qualifying Project</a>. This final degree requirement is an intensive, long-term team project; ours was completed over the school year. 
			</p>
			<p>Neurotype Cafe is a visual novel that follows Nia, a neurodivergent barista, as she handles her first week at a new cafe job. Players develop relationships with characters, prepare drinks, and manage their social energy in a thoughtful story about self-accceptance, expectations, and perfectionism. Also completed alongside the game itself were presentations of our work and a lengthy report detailing the project's goals and completion process.
			</p>
			<p>Neurotype Cafe won a <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/library/archives-special-collections/history/awards/provosts-mqp-awards?field_dept_multi_target_id_entityreference_filter=All&page=2" target="_blank">WPI Provost's Award</a>! One project is picked by faculty each year to recognize the best senior project!

			<h2>My thoughts:</h2>
			<p>
				Oh gosh, there's a lot to say about this one; I included a whole note in the game itself because I wanted to express my passion for it and thoughts on it. This was a joy to work on; great team, wonderful advisors, lovely concept. I, of course, have my many problems with it that I wish I could've ironed out; it was my baby for a bit, and finding time to work on it throughout the year was a struggle. But I'm glad I did. Honestly, it's got a lot going for it: unique mechanics, thoughtful interactions, a lot of love and care, and a pretty impressive runtime for a student project. It was proof to me I could make good things and bring passion to my work. There are even plans to continue supporting it and adding story and polish to a story I cared a lot about. And oh my gosh, it won the Provost's Award! That was a wonderful surprise.
