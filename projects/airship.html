				This custom D&D 5E campaign sees players exploring the lavish airship <i>Armada</i>. After dinner in the dining hall is suddenly interrupted by everyone falling asleep, and waking up to find their valuables— and cutlery— gone, players find themselves searching for clues to discover just what happened.
				For this student project, I tried to focus on providing many different scenarios that provided additional information about what happened in different ways, so that no matter which path players took, they would eventually have a complete enough understanding of the plot to know how the rather odd twist at the end happens. I hope you find its setting and characters as interesting as I found them fun to write!
