			<h2>About:</h2>
			<p>Slapsticklers was created over 7 weeks from conception to completion as part of the WPI IMGD program's Technical Game Design II class.
			</p>
			<p>Slapsticklers is a competitive, multiplayer platforming game that allows up to four players to battle to hold on to a battery the longest! The longer you hold on to the battery, the more charge you'll store and the bigger a building you'll build! Who will be the best construction robot?

			<h2>My thoughts:</h2>
			<p>
				Definitely one of the first projects I was really proud of. During this class, you have a <em>ton</em> of work to do in the very little time a WPI class allots you. This was also my first time using Agile development, and on top of being a programmer and spending a lot of time polishing the design, I ended up sliding into a management role to keep the project on track. It was definitely stressful, but I also had a lot of fun trying to make the most out of the very few resources we had to work with. We wouldn't have had the opportunity for many more assets than we did, and mechanics would have to be deep without imposing too much on programmers. We'd also only have the opportunity for one map. I'm really happy with how our final design turned out; we created simple mechanics that combine to create some elegant depth, arranged the assets we had to provide environmental variety, and got some time to add a lot of polish!

				(Oh, and we turned down the motion blur after release.)
