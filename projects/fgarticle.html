		<h1>Fighting games, depth vs. complexity, and how conflation of the two leads to anti-accessibility rhetoric</h1>
		<hr>

		<section id="Project description">
			An article I put together about the ways in which fighting games continue to exclude players through their control schemes, discussing how players confuse "depth" and "complexity".

			<h2>About:</h2>
			<p><em>Fighting games, depth vs. complexity, and how conflation of the two leads to anti-accessibility rhetoric</em> was written as part of an assignment for Social Issues in Interactive Media and Games.
			</p>
			<p>The article explores common conceptions about accessible design in fighting games, debunking notable myths about design, advocating for accessibility, examining design goals, and demonstrating the relationship between accessibile design and community's attitudes about their own players.

			<h2>My thoughts:</h2>
			<p>
				Wow, that title is way too long. Oops. That, and I'm not sure this article represents the best of my writing. That said, though, it was put together over 2 days for an assignment, and it's quite comprehensive, far beyond what was necessary for the assignment. It's also on a topic I'm really passionate about; I <em>love</em> thinking about the deep systemic designs of games, and fighting games are a really rich genre for deep systems that encourage player strategy. There's a prevailing narrative among fighting game fans that we cannot allow more players to enjoy fighting games because doing so would break the games mechanically, and that discussion gets mean. As a designer and fan of fighting games myself, I can't disagree with that perspective more. We can preserve both depth and accessibility without one stepping on the other; as designers, we should strive to be inclusive and think beyond the preconceived beliefs that prevent us from doing so.
