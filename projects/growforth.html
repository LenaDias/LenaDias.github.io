		<section id="About project" class="project-details">
			<h2>About:</h2>
			<p>Slide Sanctuary was created as part of a Digital Game Design class at WPI, and evolved over the course of multiple builds. It was created in <a href="https://perlenspiel.net/" target="_blank">Perlenspiel</a>, an ultra-lightweight, Javascript-based game engine, which intentionally limits graphical possibilities to encourage intelligent, elegant design.  
			</p>
			<p>Players click on one of three rooms in the dungeon to move the room into the empty space on the board (like in a slide puzzle); players must rearrange the dungeon and gather keys in order to make a path to the staircase and escape the dungeon.

			<h2>My thoughts:</h2>
			<p>
				Honestly, I'm really happy with this one! Though graphically it looks unimpressive, the real challenge with this one was working around the intentionally-imposed limitations of the Perlenspiel engine; developers have very few pixels and a single line of text to work with, and thus need to be elegant when conveying mechanics to players. With the art depicting the controls on the title screen, sound feedback, and the traditional design language of an "inventory" bar, playtesters quickly got the hang of mechanics. I feel like I did a lot with very little with this project; there's solid mechanical progression, too!
