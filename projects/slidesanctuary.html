		<section id="About project" class="project-details">
			<h2>About:</h2>
			<p>Slide Sanctuary has players click on one of three rooms in a dungeon to move the room into the empty space on the board (like in a slide puzzle); players must rearrange the dungeon and gather keys in order to make a path to the staircase.
			</p>
			<p>Made in <a href="https://perlenspiel.net/" target="_blank">Perlenspiel</a>, an intentionally lightweight, Javascript-based game engine, which intentional limits graphics to encourage elegant design.

		<section id="Lessons learned" class="project-details">
			<h2>Lessons learned:</h2>
			<h3>Prototype and QA test early.</h3>
			<p>
				Prototypes and playtesting quickly allow a designer to discover where their vision is working and where it is not (and find bugs, too!) Surveyed playtesters quickly got the hang of mechanics through the game's traditional design language, indicating to me that my design was successful and saving me a lot of redesigning down the road!
			</p>
			<h3>Find ways to communicate with the user wordlessly.</h3>
			<p>
				Though Perlenspiel is limited, it does allow for display of one line of text; that said, I did want to challenge myself to make something textless.  Through use of color, pictograms, and common game vocabulary, the player can get into the game faster and feel all the smarter for figuring things out themself.
