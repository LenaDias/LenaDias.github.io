		<section id="Lessons learned" class="project-details">
			<h2>Lessons learned:</h2>
			<h3>Research common development practices before getting started.</h3>
			<p>
				Before I got started, I researched practices for semantically-meaningful web design to create a quality page. Additional research into mobile-first design made for a site with even wider reach.
			</p>
			<h3>Personality is just as important as professionalism.</h3>
			<p>
				Without some personality, any presentation of information can prove uncompelling. I wanted to convey growth, willingness to learn, and my own personality while remaining professional. I also wanted to include some self-reflection through sections such as the "Lessons learned" block on each page (you're reading one right now!) since I believe this is one of my stronger traits! I also themed the header around brackets to allude to C/C++/C#/Java coding, which I am most familiar with!
			</p>
			<h3>Design for not just the present, but the future.</h3>
			<p>
				My previous portfolio website, developed in a rush, was inconsistently formatted, had a lot of issues. This attempt, I took extra time to incorporate what worked about the old one into the new design while spending a lot of time thinking about code structure and ease of reuse for the future; this portfolio should prove significantly more maintainable.
