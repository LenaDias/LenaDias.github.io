			<h2>About:</h2>
			<p>During their junior year, WPI undergraduate students are expected to complete an <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/project-based-learning/project-based-education/interactive-qualifying-project" target="_blank">Interactive Qualifying Project</a>, tackling a problem of societal importance that has been put forward by sponsor organizations. Students complete their IQPs in interdisciplinary teams of students outside their own major.
			</p>
			<p>Our project, sponsored by the City of Chelsea's Department of Housing & Community Development, focused on creating maps to help identify communities in the city vulnerable to environmental hazards such as high heat and air pollution. 
			</p>

			<p>
			To do so, we gathered environmental and demographic data from Chelsea's records and federal organizations and layered this information over a map of the city. Our deliverables were a comprehensive report and a massive pack of all the mapped data we found, allowing our project sponsors to examine the data themselves should they need to; after all, we were simply a student team, and not experts on community development. Much of this project was completed remotely due to COVID-19.

		<section id="Lessons learned" class="project-details">
			<h2>Lessons learned:</h2>
			<h3>Know what you don't know.</h3>
			<p>
				For this project, we were a team working outside of our areas of expertise, delivering a product meant to help experts. As a result, we asked a lot of questions and delivered files that our project stakeholders could re-analyze themselves. In our report, we acknowledged our limits as a student team, deferring to the opinions of experts in community planning. 
			</p>
			<h3>Clarify goals quickly.</h3>
			<p>
				Keeping in frequent contact with project stakeholders allowed our team to ensure that, on tight deadlines, we would deliver something of genuine worth at the end of the project without having to re-do too much work as we went. For a project that involved parsing so much data, this was a must.
