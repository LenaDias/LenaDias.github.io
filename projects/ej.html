			<h2>About:</h2>
			<p>During their junior year, WPI undergraduate students are expected to complete an <a href="https://www.wpi.edu/project-based-learning/project-based-education/interactive-qualifying-project" target="_blank">Interactive Qualifying Project</a>, tackling a problem of societal importance that has been put forward by sponsor organizations. Students complete their IQPs in interdisciplinary teams of students outside their own major.
			</p>
			<p>Our project, sponsored by the City of Chelsea's Department of Housing & Community Development, focused on creating maps to help identify communities in the city vulnerable to environmental hazards such as high heat and air pollution. To do so, we gathered environmental and demographic data from Chelsea's records and federal organizations and layered this information over a map of the city. Our primary deliverable was a massive pack of all the mapped data we found, allowing our project sponsors to examine the data themselves should they need to; after all, we were simply a student team, and not experts on community development. Much of this project was completed remotely due to COVID-19.

			<h2>My thoughts:</h2>
			<p>
				Woo! By far one of the most intensive projects I've ever had to complete, and on tight deadlines too. I had a very long nap at the end of it. Endurance and teamwork were the keys to parsing the mountains of data we gathered, and, ultimately, we ended up with something we thought would be helpful to our sponsors; a massive pack of map files that had all been organized, allowing our sponsors to filter the data themselves should they wish. After all, they have the professional expertise to do so. In the report, I wanted to make sure we maintained humblety with regard to any policy recommendations, since we were just a student team that was neither majoring in the project area nor was able to visit the city due to COVID-19 and deadlines. What we did end up with, though, was pretty polished; I'm quite happy with the final results and hope the data will be useful to the city's communities.
